# Part 5a: Login in frontend

This repo is for the [exercises 5.1 - 5.4 of Part 5a](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part5/login_in_frontend#exercises-5-1-5-4) of [Full Stack Open's React tutorial](https://fullstackopen.com). The base repository for this section was cloned from https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/bloglist-frontend.

# 5.1
clone base repo and implement functionality to log a user in.

# 5.2
Frontend should remember logged in users and allow them to log out.

# 5.3
Added login message (missed from 5.2). Allow logged in users to add new blogs. This is the first time I am unsure if I have chosen to do things in a "React" way with the Login and BlogForm components, where I am placing state related to the inputs of the components. After reading arguments on the internet, I am still unsure XD
